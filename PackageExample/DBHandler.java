/**
	To use this demo class please follow instructions from 

HelloWorldTWo.java prior to these instructions.

	Place the "DBHandler.java" file into your java folder, 

then compile using the following command: "javac -d classes 

DBHandler.java". 

	Go back to your HelloWorldTwo.java file and un-comment 

the import statement or write the following import statement: 

"import com.deanharrison.database.DBHandler;" then create an 

instance of the DBHandler class by using the following line of 

code: "DBHandler db = new DBHandler();"

	To compile your updated HelloWorldTwo.java file you 

need to use the following compiler command: "java -d classes 

-cp classes HelloWorldTwo.java", this will place the compiled 

files into the classes folder but also look inside the classes 

folder for any classes you may be referencing, in this case 

the DBHandler.class will be found.

	To run the HelloWorldTwo.java file is the same as 

previously: "java -cp classes 

com.deanharrison.test.HelloWorldTwo.java"

	Any questions please don't hesitate to ask.
